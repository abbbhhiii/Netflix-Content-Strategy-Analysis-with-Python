# Netflix Content Strategy Analysis with Python


### Content Strategy Analysis means analyzing how content is created, released, distributed, and consumed to achieve specific goals, such as maximizing audience engagement, viewership, brand reach, or revenue.

#### For the task of Netflix Content Strategy Analysis, we need data based on content titles, type (show or movie), genre, language, and release details (date, day of the week, season) to understand timing and content performance. Viewership metrics like hours viewed are also crucial for measuring audience engagement.I found an ideal dataset for this task, which contains data about title, release date, language, content type (show or movie), availability status, and viewership hours of the content on Netflix of all the shows and movies released in 2023.

### Problem
- The goal is to analyze Netflixâ€™s content strategy to understand how various factors like content type, language, release season, and timing affect viewership patterns. By identifying the best-performing content and the timing of its release, the aim is to uncover insights into how Netflix maximizes audience engagement throughout the year.

- ### Dataset information: 
- The dataset consists of Netflix content released globally in 2023, containing information on the title, release date, language, content type (show or movie), availability status, and viewership hours. The dataset allows exploration of patterns in viewership based on various attributes like content type, release season, language, and release day. The viewership data, represented in hours viewed, serves as a proxy for the popularity and audience engagement of each title.

- ##### Conclusion
- So, the content strategy of Netflix revolves around maximizing viewership through targeted release timing and content variety. Shows consistently outperform movies in viewership, with significant spikes in December and June, indicating strategic releases around these periods. The Fall season stands out as the peak time for audience engagement. Most content is released on Fridays, which aims to capture viewers right before the weekend, and viewership aligns strongly with this release pattern. While the number of releases is steady throughout the year, viewership varies, which suggests a focus on high-impact titles and optimal release timing over sheer volume.
